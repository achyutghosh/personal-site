# Intro
Hi, I'm Achyut. I like building things & solving problems. Besides, music in my lifeline & love to play ukulele for detoxification. Practicing meditation has become my new dope.

# Currently
Currently I'm working at [Ginesys](https://ginesys.in/) as a software developer & problem solver. At Ginesys, I've learned how to write quality code, understand enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/), [Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview), [Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) etc.
